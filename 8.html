<p class="chaptertitle">What Makes a Great Analytic Professional?</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Before we get into the chapter, you’re going to take a little quiz. It’s a very simple quiz, so don’t stress out. What you need to do is sit back and think for a few minutes about what the most important traits are in a world-class advanced analytics professional. We’ll call such a person an analytic professional for our discussion. Think of the kind of person who will be capable of creating the great analysis discussed in Chapter 7 and taming big data. These are the highly skilled, trained professionals who build predictive models, create forecasts, and similar activities, as opposed to those who mainly build complex spreadsheets or reports. Develop a list of the three to five traits that you would consider most important. What are they? Your list can contain anything you think is important. Once you’ve got your list together, continue reading.</p>
<p class="para">Most of the readers of this book probably got the answer at least partially wrong. The reason for that is that there are some very common assumptions made about what’s most important in a great analytic professional, and many of those assumptions are incomplete, if not just plain wrong! This chapter will delve into why this is true, and will discuss the traits that differentiate a great analytic professional from the rest of the pack. First, let’s define in more detail what we mean by the term analytic professional.</p>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0002">WHO IS THE ANALYTIC PROFESSIONAL?</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The people who fall under the umbrella of analytic professional go by a variety of names. The most common names used traditionally include those such as analyst, data miner, predictive modeler, and statistician, among others. Recently, the term data scientist has become quite common, especially among those who spend a lot of time analyzing big data and using tools like MapReduce. For our purposes here, we will consider all of these people to be analytic professionals.</p>
<p class="para">The fact of the matter is that there are many more similarities than there are differences in the underlying skill sets of people who use the various preceding titles. On a day-to-day basis, each type of professional is leveraging data to solve a business problem. There may be some different tools or algorithms used by different types of analytic professionals, but a great analytic professional that works in one area should be able to transfer those skills to another if desired. As we’ll show in this chapter, the things that differentiate a great analytic professional from the rest of the pack really have nothing to do with the tools, algorithms, or data that he or she typically works with.</p>
<p class="para">Most pointedly, the new community of data scientists isn’t too different from the community of traditional analysts. Just as analysts have always focused on finding new and useful ways to leverage data to solve business problems, data scientists are focused on finding new ways to leverage data to solve business problems. The fact that the data scientists tend to use different toolsets, programming languages, and data sets doesn’t make their underlying goals and purpose different. The same underlying skills and competencies come into play.</p>
<p class="para">The only thing stopping a great traditional analyst from becoming a great data scientist is some training and study. The same goes in reverse as well. Any great analytic professional will have no problem picking up a new programming language or tool on top of those already used. And, every great analytic professional will jump at the chance to learn about a new data source and how it can be applied.</p>
<p class="para">Those who consider themselves analytic professionals, whether they use the term data scientist, analyst, or something else, should agree with all of the points made in this chapter. Those who interact with these professionals should agree as well. It is important that analytic professionals understand how much more similar they are to each other than some may think. The same traits and behaviors are the hallmark of any great analytic professional.</p>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0003">THE COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT ANALYTIC PROFESSIONALS</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Most people asked to produce a list of important traits for analytic professionals will include some sort of specific degree. It is usually assumed that a great analytic professional is going to need a statistics, math, computer science, operations research, or similar degree. Often, it is assumed that success will require a master’s or PhD degree. Another area people tend to focus on heavily is programming experience. They’ll say that a great analytic professional needs to know how to program in any of a variety of languages that are used for analysis. The logic behind this criterion is that there are tools such people use, and a great analytic professional must be able to use those tools well.</p>
<p class="para">Here’s why those two broad areas just mentioned, which are almost universally selected, miss the mark. The fact is that a great analytic professional <span class="italic">will</span> need a strong base of knowledge in math and statistics. A formal degree? Not necessarily. It is possible to learn on the job and through other means than a formal degree. A great analytic professional will also need programming skills since all the major analytical tools require some level of programming knowledge to use them optimally. However, those programming skills don’t guarantee success, either.</p>
<p class="para">The reason these answers aren’t correct ties to a phrase used in mathematical proofs: <span class="italic">necessary, but not sufficient</span>. Having skills in statistics, math, and programming is certainly necessary to be a great analytic professional, but they are not sufficient to make a person a great analytic professional. More is required beyond those basics. Having the base math and programming skills is a given. While those skills are important, they are not the most important factors in distinguishing a great analytic professional from a not-so-great one. They are just the starting point.</p>
<p class="para">If a hiring manager focuses too much on technical skills and academic knowledge, he or she will too often end up with an employee who’s focused on those things rather than the big picture of generating a meaningful analysis. It is important that an organization include other criteria in the search for great analytic professionals. After all, nobody needs a “statistics geek” sitting in the corner running fancy algorithms day and night. That won’t lead to success.</p>
<p class="para">What is needed is an analytic professional who’s going to be part of the team. Who will understand the business problems an organization is trying to solve. Who will understand how to generate the analysis needed to address the organization’s business problems effectively. You can’t tame big data without some top-notch talent. Let’s now discuss some of the criteria to consider when finding that talent.</p>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0004">EVERY GREAT ANALYTIC PROFESSIONAL IS AN EXCEPTION</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One thing that’s surprised me over the years is how virtually every great analytic professional that I know is an exception to the rules in some way. I know others in the field who have had the same experience. What does it mean that great analytic professionals tend to be the exceptions? If working from a list of what are commonly considered the prime traits of a great analytic professional, most of the great ones will violate one or more of those traits! Let’s start with some discussion on why some traits aren’t as important as they seem before we move on to the more important traits.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0001">Education</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">There’s a gentleman I worked with years ago who is one of the best analytic professionals I’ve ever known. Let’s call him Bart. Bart joined our then-employer before I was hired, so I didn’t know what his background was when I started. What I did realize pretty quickly was that this guy really knew his stuff. I could go to him and he could help me with programming questions, he could help me with statistics questions, and he could help me understand the company’s business, which I was trying to learn as a new employee. Most important, he could help me understand our clients’ businesses.</p>
<p class="para">Over time I found out that he had “only” an undergraduate business degree. Bart didn’t have any advanced degrees. He didn’t have any formal statistics or math degrees. He had an undergrad business degree along with the associated basic statistics classes that came with it. He also hadn’t had any formal training in programming. He had taught himself how to program.</p>
<p class="para">When Bart got on the job, he took some courses and learned the fundamentals he needed to know about statistics from the experienced people he worked with. He also picked up some books. Bart learned how to do the programming he needed to do by jumping in and figuring it out. He turned himself into one of the best analytic professionals I’ve ever known. But technically, he had none of the formal educational and technical training that would be expected. It didn’t matter. He is exactly the kind of person you’d want taming big data for you. Don’t focus exclusively on formal education. Focus on whether an analytic professional has learned what is required to do the job.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0002">Industry Experience</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It’s very common for companies and hiring managers to worry about what industry an analytic professional, or anyone else, has experience in. If there is an analytic professional in telecom, many assume that there’s no way he or she can add value in banking. If the analytic professional is in banking, many assume there’s no way he or she can add value in manufacturing. If the analytic professional is in manufacturing, they won’t even think about having him or her work in retail.</p>
<p class="para">That’s not really fair. Given the choice between two equally qualified candidates, one who knows an industry and one who doesn’t, of course it can make sense to take the one who knows the industry. The choice is rarely that clean, however. Consider a choice between two people. One is a mediocre analytic professional who knows an industry in and out. The other is a phenomenal analytic professional in another industry who knows nothing about the industry in question. Take the latter any day. A great analytic professional in one industry can learn about another and become great there, too. A mediocre analytic professional is likely to stay that way. In addition, getting some outside perspectives from another industry can be quite beneficial. Every industry has certain ways of doing things. A team can learn a lot from somebody outside the industry.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">LOOK OUTSIDE</div>
<div class="featurepara">Now and then, look outside your industry when hiring an analytic professional. If people are great analytic professionals, they’ll pick up your business pretty quickly. They’ll also cross-pollinate your team with all of the ideas and approaches they bring from their background. Hiring a person from a competitor who already does exactly what you want him or her to do isn’t always a bad thing, but you do need to mix it up over time.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Let’s illustrate the pitfalls of an unbending industry requirement through the true story of a gentleman named Mark. Mark had been focused primarily on the banking industry for several decades. Our team was under a resource crunch, and we really needed help on a project at a retail account. One thing that everyone agreed upon was that Mark was a very, very good analytic professional. But could he succeed in a retail project given his banking background?</p>
<p class="para">Great analytic professionals will agree that if someone “gets it” in one industry, he or she can get it in another. He or she may have to change his or her thinking somewhat, learn some new terminology, and compute some different metrics, but he or she can succeed. That’s a true statement about many other disciplines as well. Mark was given the opportunity to work on the retail project. He agreed to put in the extra time required to learn about the industry and also agreed to work closely with the retail experts assigned. Even that first project was a success, and within months, Mark was meeting with other retail customers who thought that he had been doing retail for years! This was because Mark “got” the underlying business concepts and was able to translate everything he knew from his past in banking into the retail environment. He was motivated, creative, and smart. That’s what really mattered.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0003">Beware “The List”</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A few years ago, my company’s human resources (HR) department came to me and said, “We have some new rules, so you need to update the list of required and preferred traits for your job openings. From now on anything you put down as required will be absolutely required.” In other words, if the position description says a candidate has to have a bachelor’s or better in statistics, it would not be possible to interview or hire anybody that didn’t have it.</p>
<p class="para">I thought about it and I sent back to HR my revised list with a long list of preferred attributes. My required attribute list had only one item: a bachelor’s degree with no specification of discipline. The only reason a bachelor’s degree was listed was to ensure that candidates had some level of higher education. Honestly, the list may have been too harsh even with that single requirement.</p>
<p class="para">HR called and said, “Hey, Bill, did you make a mistake? You’ve basically got nothing required here. Aren’t there some things that are important and that you’re going to have to have?” I told them what I just discussed. I said, “Honestly, every person on my team violates at least one or two of the things that I would normally put as required. If I put something as required, and I won’t be able to make an exception, then I can’t list it. I can’t take the risk that I have to pass over a good person because the job description is set in stone. I’d rather have an ambiguous job description and be able to get the right person.”</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">HIRE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS, NOT CHECK BOXES</div>
<div class="featurepara">When hiring analytic professionals, it is fine to start with a laundry list of experiences and education as a starting point. Having some, but not necessarily all, of the boxes checked is a reasonable first pass. But it isn’t sufficient. Many aspects of a great analytic professional involve factors that aren’t technical in nature at all. In fact, great analytic professionals are distinguished from the pack based less on technical skills than on other factors such as those we’ll discuss next.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0005">THE OFTEN UNDERRATED TRAITS OF A GREAT ANALYTIC PROFESSIONAL</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Let’s talk about a handful of traits that are absolutely critical in a great analytic professional. While these traits are also valuable for a range of other disciplines, it doesn’t negate the importance of them to analytics. Each of the following are of higher importance than any of the traits we’ve already discussed. While a lower bar exists for maintaining established analytic processes, recruiting and retaining the right talent are paramount when an organization is looking to break new ground and build new analytic processes. A higher bar must be crossed to tame big data and create the new, innovative, business-changing analytic processes that big data enables.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0004">Commitment</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Commitment is a trait that benefits every profession. There are people who will do whatever it takes to hit a deadline or make a project succeed. However, there are people who are willing to put in only so much effort. Within your organization, you can probably identify the people you can count on and those you can’t. Any great analytic professional is going to be committed. Luckily, this trait tends to come across in an interview based on how the candidate describes his or her past work and successes. Listen carefully to ensure you pick up on a candidate’s level of commitment.</p>
<p class="para">There really isn’t much more that needs to be said about commitment. It is universally understood to be important across fields. This includes the field of analytics.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0005">Creativity</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Creativity isn’t something that most people consider when thinking about an analytic professional. Most people think that an analytic professional is running statistical formulas that are pretty well defined. He or she is going to go by the book, and there’s nothing creative about it. Is that true?</p>
<p class="para">Well, not really. The bottom line is that every business problem is different, and the data available to address each problem is often complex and incomplete. An analytic professional has to figure out how he or she is going to put the data together in new ways to solve the latest problem. That takes a good bit of creativity. There’s no book or set of rules that says how to make a lot of those decisions and how to do it correctly.</p>
<p class="para">Additionally, every single time an analytic professional is going through an analysis, he or she is going to hit some unforeseen issues. Sometimes they’re minor bumps. Sometimes they’re pretty major snags. Those “Oh, @#%$&amp;*!!!” moments pop up and make the analytic professionals realize that they’ve got a big problem. Creativity is what allows someone to come up with a novel solution to such problems. The problem might be with the data, or it might be that there is an aspect of the business that wasn’t understood until getting into the weeds of the analysis. Creativity is how to get around those barriers and still get to an end result that hits the mark.</p>
<p class="para">Don’t underestimate the importance of creativity in an analytic professional. It is not the most common of traits among those who will call themselves analytic professionals, either. Creativity is a huge filter. If you talk to 10 people, you’ll be lucky if a couple of them even begin to meet the bar for creativity. Some organizations utilize personality tests or have candidates solve seemingly random problems in order to evaluate creativity. One way I like to gauge creativity is to ask candidates about some past analysis “Oh, @#%$&amp;*!!!” moments that they had to overcome. A creative analytic professional will have a good story to tell you. An analytic professional who isn’t creative will simply supply a list of steps he or she took to try to overcome the problem.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0001">Clean Data Is Only in Textbooks</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Does the topic of clean data really fit in a section on how creativity helps define a great analytic professional? It does. This is because analytic professionals often have to get quite creative in how they handle data. The fact is that data is never, ever as clean as they want it to be, and it is often not as clean as it really needs to be. The data always has gaps, inconsistencies, and just plain errors. It also almost always violates some of the assumptions being made as part of an analysis plan.</p>
<p class="para">In school, it is wonderful to have data that is accurate, clean, and complete. If there are any data points that don’t fit, it is possible to identify why and adjust for them. Everyone in school gets this crazy idea that the textbook examples reflect what they’ll come across in the business world. Well, in business, it doesn’t work that way. The data is never as nice as it is in class. A gender code will contain something random like an “H” in addition to the expected “M,” “F,” and “U” (for unknown). A customer will have sales of $10,000,000 at a grocery store. A product will be sold that has a product code that does not exist.</p>
<p class="para">These situations pose a serious problem. Namely, what can be done when the data isn’t really what is wanted and needed? Should the customer with unrealistic sales be ignored? Should the “H” be changed to a “U”? Can the correct product code be identified? Figuring out how to make the best of the data an analysis has available is one of the hardest parts of any analytics effort, and it can require quite a bit of creativity. Once an analytic professional finds that the data isn’t complete enough to fully answer what was hoped, it is time to get creative in figuring out ways to get the most possible from it. This involves ignoring or correcting some data. It may be necessary to identify some small wins and make them happen quickly, then direct focus to improving those wins.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">GO FOR IMPROVEMENT, NOT PERFECTION</div>
<div class="featurepara">You’ve got to go after business problems with the goal of improving results, not perfection. This is critical. It is easy to get hung up on the fact that with a little more work, a little more lift can be achieved by getting the data a little cleaner. Great analytic professionals focus on improving results and squeezing out what they can from subpar data. Results may not be perfect, but if they enable an improved decision then that is okay.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Analysis of loyalty card data is one area where data is never perfect. Even the best customers don’t remember to use their card every time. What this means is that the “complete” picture of each customer’s spending really isn’t complete at all. However, all is not lost. Really good customers will tend to use their card most of the time. There will still be enough data to understand them. The fact that some data is missing isn’t going to ruin the analysis. Sure, some customers may be slightly misunderstood based on the partial information, but the data is complete enough to make good decisions. Great analytic professionals understand this.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0002">Clean-Enough Data</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One important question great analytic professionals ask about data, no matter how dirty it is or how much it violates assumptions, is whether or not it is clean enough. Can they get results that they can believe in? Can they get results using the data that are solid enough that they can have confidence that real gains are possible? If the answer is yes, then they go for it. The data doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be good enough to get to a decision point. Great analytic professionals are very good at getting creative in the ways in which they validate that data is clean enough.</p>
<p class="para">Let’s consider a data source that is widely used, but that is full of error. Household demographic files have been available for decades. On average, the demographic data providers do a good job of getting accurate information on households. However, the data on any specific household may be incorrect since there are assumptions that are made throughout the process of compiling the data. This doesn’t stop the data from being useful. High-level patterns and trends can be believed, even if specific households within those trends may have problems. Marketers have used such data to great advantage even though it isn’t perfect. There are creative ways to adjust for known biases and issues. If the data was ignored due to the errors within it, a lot of value would be left on the table.</p>
<p class="para">Within a corporate environment, a great analytic professional will similarly be able to get creative and figure out how to use corporate data sources to drive value. It is a matter of looking at the data available as a glass half full of value rather than as a glass half empty of value. This skill is even more valuable when dealing with big data due to facts discussed in Chapter 1. Big data often isn’t clean and often contains extraneous information that must be filtered out.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0006">Business Savvy</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Great analytic professionals have the ability to understand the business model that they’re working within, and how analytics can address that business’s problems. Great analytic professionals are going to be able to focus on what the important metrics and outcomes from the business perspective are, as well as the important metrics from a technical perspective. They’re going to take the time and make the effort to achieve that level of understanding. Regardless of a person’s innate talents in the area of business savvy, it requires interest and focus to develop it well. If someone doesn’t have the interest and desire to understand your business, he or she won’t become a great analytic professional for you.</p>
<p class="para">Note that business savvy and industry experience are not the same thing. Industry experience is more a set of facts and knowledge. Business savvy is a softer set of skills. A person who is very business savvy in general will not have trouble picking up a new industry. Great analytic professionals such as Mark, who we discussed earlier, are able to apply their underlying savvy to a wide range of situations and problems. As you interview analytic professionals, probe into why they made the decisions they made during past projects. If they are business savvy, they will mention some practical business considerations along with the technical considerations. Discussion will also include comments on why certain concerns were more or less relevant given the business issues being addressed. An analytic professional without business savvy will focus primarily on the technical requirements and assumptions.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">AN ODD HYBRID</div>
<div class="featurepara">Great analytic professionals are an odd hybrid. In some aspects of their job, they need to be as technical as a pure IT person. In others aspects, they need to be as business savvy as a pure businessperson. Straddling both those worlds is difficult, which why it is hard to find really great analytic professionals.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0003">The Right Level of Granularity</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One aspect of business savvy is being able to tie analysis results to the granularity of the decision to be made. What does that mean? Let’s say a businessperson comes to an analytic professional to improve a marketing campaign. If a model can be built that will perform 2 percent better than the current approach, it will be a winner. In this case, the analytic professional has been given a bar to cross. He or she needs to be confident that the current results can be beaten by at least 2 percent.</p>
<p class="para">When presenting the results, is he or she going to say that the model beat the baseline performance by 5.32526 percent? Hopefully not. This is particularly true if the margin of error is plus or minus 2 percent. Who cares that the point estimate is 5.32526 percent when the margin of error is plus or minus 2 percent? Going to the level of thousandths of a percent is a distraction. The key is to communicate that results can be improved a little over 5 percent, plus or minus 2 percent. The worst case is somewhere north of 3 percent, so the model is a clear winner given the bar of 2 percent. That’s all that the business people need to worry about. A great analytic professional won’t confuse the business team with more detail than is needed and adds value. They’ll use their business savvy to determine what to provide and how to position it.</p>
<p class="para">One additional example relates to demand forecasts. A few years ago, a vendor was able to prove that its demand forecasts were much more accurate than the competition’s. On average, the vendor showed that the organization only needed three extra units on hand, rather than the four extra units that the competition recommended. The project sponsors were pleased, but then threw out a question that brought the excitement down a bit. The sponsors pointed out that they had to order in minimum increments of six units! Given that, how could they address either of the forecasts effectively? When the granularity of action is six units, anything pointing to a finer level of action is useless. An analytic professional who has a high level of business savvy and is focused on framing their problems correctly will identify and account for such a constraint up front.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0004">Focusing on the Important</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Data often violates assumptions. A lot of models require the assumption of a normal distribution, for example. Theoretically, there are big concerns when such assumptions are violated. In practice, however, if there’s a strong relationship between two factors, that relationship is typically going to show up in some fashion regardless of what method is used. Does that mean that the parameter estimates and the projections of impact will be identical across various modeling options if the assumptions are badly violated? No. But it does mean that an important factor will usually be found to be important across the various methods even if assumptions are violated. If a high level of granularity is not needed, a rough read can be just fine.</p>
<p class="para">Is it possible to have a scenario with a perfect U-shaped curve that violates the linear relationship assumption so perfectly that a linear regression will say there is no association at all between two variables? Yes, it’s possible. The point is that it’s not probable, and in most cases the fact that a relationship is present will be identified. If the sponsor of an analysis is looking for a rough read on a yes/no decision, the data and models need to be accurate enough to say yes or no. A great analytic professional knows when to dial up or down the precision of a result based on what is required. See <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/taming-the-big/9781118208786/c09.xhtml#c08fig0001x" id="c08fig0001xa">Figure 8.1</a> for an example of some data that totally violates the assumption of a linear relationship. However, a regression line still captures the essence of the relationship effectively if all that is required is to understand if the two factors tend to vary together.</p>

<h3 id="c08-sec3-0005">Cultural Awareness</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The use of offshore resources, typically from a developing country, is a huge trend across industries. For better or worse, it’s hit the analytics industry as well. We are not going to cover the political and philosophical arguments about whether offshoring is good or bad from an economic or moral perspective. Those arguments are for another day. What we do want to address is whether offshoring, as it’s offered today, can meet the needs of business analytics.</p>
<p class="para">Most offshore providers as of this writing focus on technical skill sets, and on providing a technically trained team. They will stress how they’ve got 25 PhD’s in statistics armed with every software package in use today. Just supply them with a problem and they’ll crank out an answer. The problem is that we’ve already discussed how technical skills are only a starting point for a great analytic professional. In addition, it is very hard to be business savvy if you’ve never even seen the businesses you are analyzing in action.</p>
<p class="para">Skills offshore providers offer can be helpful in assisting to solve well-defined analytical problems. But there are huge pitfalls when relying on offshore resources to supply end-to-end analytics support. Consider the typical situation where there is somebody half a world away, many time zones away, and a language barrier. These issues can be difficult by themselves. Now consider the huge cultural differences the offshore providers have and their lack of experience with how things work in the country they are working with.</p>
<p class="para">Note that the same hazards apply regardless of who is providing the remote support. Americans will have just as much trouble providing meaningful analysis to a business in India that they have never seen as analytic professionals in India will have providing meaningful analysis on an American business they’ve never seen.</p>
<p class="para">A colleague told me a great story about an organization in the grocery industry that hired offshore resources to do analysis of their pet food category. As we start the story, picture in your head dog food cans and bags, some of which have a picture of a happy dog on the label. The analysis came back, and it was clear from the verbiage in the analysis documentation, as well as the verbal presentation, that the analytic professionals had completely misinterpreted what pet food products were. The results were not about pet food. The results were about—wait for it—canned dog meat! Do you see where this is going yet? The offshore team had interpreted that the smiling dog on the package wasn’t happy to get the pet food that was in the can waiting for him. Rather, he was put in that can so we could have him for dinner!</p>
<p class="para">Again, a similar issue could just as easily have arisen if the roles were reversed. It is very hard to have the right level of business savvy when totally unfamiliar with the business and the culture in which the business operates. Can offshore resources help? Yes, if they are used appropriately. Don’t toss a business analysis problem over the wall and expect an offshore team with a purely technical background to set the analytic strategy, interpret the results, and spoon-feed you their findings. You need to have some really good, business-savvy analytic professionals guiding the process from your home base if it’s going to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0007">Presentation and Communication Skills</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Presentation and communication skills are critical to many jobs, including analytic professionals. No matter how good an analytic professional is at getting to the right results, if he or she has moved beyond an entry-level job, it will be necessary to not only produce strong analytic results, but also be able to tie the results together in a compelling, succinct story. A great analytic professional is going to be able to engage non-technical people and get them interested and excited about findings in terms that they can understand. He or she will weave an interesting story rather than recite statistics and facts.</p>
<p class="para">An analytic professional can’t come into the room talking about collinearity diagnostics, detailed model summary statistics, and other highly technical details to a business audience. He or she needs to come in and say, “Here’s what we found, here’s why it’s important, and here’s what you should consider doing as a result.” There should also be discussion of exactly how the businesspeople will benefit from taking action. Will sales of their products increase? Will profit margins widen? At the end of the day, businesspeople care about how an analysis will help them, not all the technical points of how it was generated.</p>
<p class="para">The communication of the results needs to be done in a short, to-the-point fashion. There’s a large component of written communication skills involved, whether the analytic professional is putting together a slide show or a written document. There’s also a large component of verbal communication and presentation skills, whether the analytic professional is doing a formal presentation or simply having an informal discussion in an office.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">TAKE A TEST DRIVE</div>
<div class="featurepara">A terrific way to assess the presentation and communication skills of an analytic professional is to require him or her to give a presentation as part of the interview process. You’ll see what the person is made of and will be able to tell if you’re looking at someone with potential to be a great analytic professional within your organization or not.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Not every analytic professional has to be comfortable getting in front of an auditorium full of people at a conference, or in front of an executive committee meeting. Not in the early stages of a career, at least. But every great analytic professional will need to be able to get in front of project sponsors and/or his or her own management in an office or conference room and walk through his or her results. One terrific way to assess candidates’ presentation skills is to require a presentation as part of the interview process. You can either assign them a general topic or allow them to pick something of their choice. You will see them in action and under pressure. Where a candidate’s communication skills stand will be clear within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0006">Results Aren’t the Most Important Aspect of Success</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">This claim may be a surprise. However, the most important factor in determining if a given analytics project will succeed or fail is not the quality of the analytic results. In an ideal world, that would be the case. But, it isn’t true in the real world that we live in. First of all, let’s make clear that absolutely, positively getting results correct is important. It’s crucially important and every analytic professional must ensure that results are accurate every time. At the end of the day, however, from the viewpoint of the people who sponsor analysis projects, the results themselves are at most 50 percent of the criteria that will determine if they view the project a success. So what else could possibly matter so much?</p>
<p class="para">At least 50 percent of the success of a project will be how well an analytic professional is able to put together a presentation and document the results. Is he or she able to position his or her results effectively? Is the analytic professional able to interpret things in a way that makes sense to his or her audience so they will be comfortable taking action? This is something that can’t be stressed enough. A great analytic professional can’t just focus on the right analytics, however tempting that may be. He or she also has to leave time to focus on the right interpretation, positioning, and selling of the results to the businesspeople who asked for the analysis.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">IT’S THE DELIVERY, STUPID!</div>
<div class="featurepara">It takes hard work and practice to develop the ability to distill a lengthy and complex set of results down to digestible sound bites. At times, analytic professionals will feel they are watering things down too much. While it is necessary to have the details and defense of findings available, they shouldn’t be brought out until necessary. The business team’s eyes will glaze over, they’ll tune out, and they won’t use the results if discussion goes too deep. A great analytic professional will deliver results in a way that keeps the sponsors engaged and interested.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">A business team won’t care about the 10 weeks of effort and all the gory details waded through to get to the results. They care about the results. Analytic professionals must get the results across to them effectively, or the results may as well not exist. Again, producing great results is necessary, but not sufficient to have the project viewed as a success. Great analytic professionals understand this and put the appropriate focus on the delivery process.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0007">A Lesson from the Advertising Industry</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Analytic professionals like to measure things. They like to do things in such a way that it can be proven if efforts are working or not. In the direct marketing industry, it’s very clean-cut. Analytic professionals run a model and generate a list of people who should be e-mailed, called, or otherwise contacted. On the back end, it can be measured very exactly what the lift was from those efforts. If it worked, more of the same can be done. If it didn’t work, the team can stop and try something else.</p>
<p class="para">One of the biggest budgets on a lot of companies’ books is mass advertising in the form of TV, radio, newspapers, and so on. Such media do have a role and can have an impact. However, it is nearly impossible to get a highly accurate measure of the impact of such efforts. To assess the impacts of advertising is notoriously tricky. Methodologies that try to estimate market level lift in sales due to market level TV, radio, and print campaigns are dicey at best. Methodologies at a lower level, such as a store level, aren’t a lot better. Yet advertising is still pervasive, even when there are other, more measurable options available that budgets could shift to. Why is that?</p>
<p class="para">One reason is because when a direct marketer comes in to talk about building analytics to do better targeted marketing, there’s nothing overly sexy or exciting about it. A direct marketing analysis will identify who is statistically most likely to respond, and then an organization targets them to (hopefully!) drive more sales. Sure, the drive-more-sales part gets people’s eyes lit up, but there’s nothing really exciting about the storyline.</p>
<p class="para">What do ad agencies do when they pitch their plans? They show up with a multimedia presentation. They’ll have music. They’ll have video. They’ll have new catch phrases. They’re going to get the audience so pumped up about their plans that they’re ready to sign up. Even the fact that it can’t be measured cleanly on the back end doesn’t matter so much, because the audience has bought into the vision and the excitement of what that ad agency is suggesting they do.</p>
<p class="para">The intention is not to pick on ad agencies (please don’t send the nasty letters). Rather, the intent is to compliment them! The point is that advertising is not nearly as measurable as some other activities, yet it has maintained a huge share of expenditures. That is in part because of the advertising industry’s ability to make what they do compelling to their sponsors. Advertising agencies fully understand and leverage the power of presentation and communication. An analytic professional who wants to be great can learn some lessons by studying how the ad agencies do things. Imagine how powerful a project can be if highly measurable actions and associated analytics are paired with the excitement level that advertising activities instill in the business community.</p>
<h2 id="c08-sec2-0008">Intuition</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Intuition is probably the hardest to define of the traits we’ll discuss. It is certainly the hardest to assess in someone until you see him or her in action. For our purposes, intuition is the ability for an analytic professional to somehow just see or feel what needs to be done next. When a barrier is hit, the analytic professional sits and thinks it through. He or she determines that any of paths A, B, C, or D can be taken, given the situation. How well does he or she choose? Does he or she seem to have a great intuitive feel for which of those directions is going to pay off? Can he or she pick an option and be successful most of the time? Or does he or she fumble through stops and starts across various options before finally coming up with a plan? Great analytic professionals have an uncanny ability to pick a good path more often than not.</p>
<p class="para">There’s a good book I recommend you consider reading. It is called <span class="italic">A Whole New Mind</span> by Daniel H. Pink (Riverhead Trade, 2006). It has some very interesting perspectives on the general, ongoing migration from a largely technical focus in terms of what will help people succeed in the world, to having more of a focus on the traits we have been talking about. Pink’s book may help drive some of the themes we’ve discussed home for you on a broader scale.</p>
<p class="para">In many ways, intuition is an inherent skill. But it can also be tuned and groomed. Ultimately, intuition is a blend of a problem-solving approach and experience from having hit similar situations and worked through them in the past. Building on those experi­ences and approaches, it is necessary to be smart enough to recognize when to apply previous learnings again and when to tweak them to a new situation.</p>
<p class="para">A good intuition is a big factor in determining a great analytic professional, but it is very difficult to assess someone’s intuition level during an interview. Some of the criteria that might seem relevant may not pass muster with human resources since they are too subjective and “squishy.” Over time, you will be able to identify if an analytic professional has good intuition or not based on his or her performance and handling of problems.</p>
<h3 id="c08-sec3-0008">Art versus Science</h3>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One of the primary themes to grasp that has been under the surface of this chapter is that analytics isn’t just about science. It is about art, too. A great analysis has a combination of solid science combined with a strong dose of artistry. The artistry in an analysis is figuring out how to deal with unusual problems, how to put together a compelling presentation, and how to best interpret the findings. A great analytic professional must be able to provide both the science and the art components. A great analytic professional isn’t just a scientist but an artist as well!</p>
<p class="para">Consider the example of cluster analysis, a common set of algorithms used for segmentation models. There are no simple, widely accepted metrics that identify the right answer. Segmentation modeling is actually pretty artistic. Analytic professionals who do a lot of segmentation models all have their own guidelines for what they look for. For example, I have a process I go through when assessing such models. I know when I’m doing it where I’m heading and what patterns I’m looking for; I’d have a very hard time explaining some of it effectively to someone else, however. Similarly, others have had trouble explaining their methods to me. Everyone has their own twist to how they assess segmentation models, and those twists have a large component of art to them.</p>
<p class="para">If trust is an important factor in the work of an analytic profession­al being accepted in general, it is even more important when dealing with analytics that involve a large artistic component. When there aren’t clear metrics that point to one choice or another, business sponsors will have to trust their analytic professionals’ intuition and how they apply the art of analytics. This is a fairly big leap of faith, and one that takes time to build up to. A great analytic professional will build this trust over time and will become a true trusted advisor to his or her business partners.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">ANALYTIC PROFESSIONALS AS ARTISTS</div>
<div class="featurepara">Just as two different painters can interpret a scene in totally different ways yet both yield very compelling artwork, so can two different people doing an analysis come up with different approaches that are very compelling in different ways. That’s the artistry of analytics. Some algorithms leave less room for artistry, but artistry always underlies the decisions on how to best define a problem, design an analysis, and work through the available data to arrive at a solution. Great analytic professional are artists as much as scientists.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">A big discussion topic recently in the analytics community has been that of a data scientist role within organizations. As we discussed at the start of the chapter, there isn’t a big difference between what a data scientist does, as it’s being defined today, and what advanced analytics professionals have always done. There may be a few different tools, such as MapReduce, that a long-time analyst needs to learn to meet the definition of data scientist, but learning new tools isn’t anything new to such people. Does a data scientist have some new tools in the toolbox? Yes. Does he or she have a whole new purpose? No.</p>
<p class="para">Equally important to the concept of a data scientist is looking at analytic professionals as data artists. These are the people who are going to dig into corporate data. They’re going to create something out of it that helps solve a problem in an elegant and compelling fashion. Just as a painter will convert paints into a painting to hang in a house, data artists are going to convert data into a solution to a business problem.</p>
<p class="para">Great analytic professionals will be artists as much as scientists. It is the combination of those two sets of skills that makes them great more than either alone. If you are skeptical of this claim, ask some great analytic professionals you know about their other skills or hobbies. You’ll find surprisingly many also have a very strong talent for music, art, or some other creative discipline that isn’t always widely known about them.</p>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0006">IS ANALYTICS CERTIFICATION NEEDED, OR IS IT NOISE?</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">There has been a lot discussion recently about developing certification programs for analytic professionals. Such certifications would be similar in concept to how there are certified public accountants (CPAs) or certified financial planners (CFPs). Is there a need for analytic professionals to have a certification program that allows employers to identify who can meet minimum standards?</p>
<p class="para">I’ve read about and had discussions about some terrific ideas in terms of the kind of programs various organizations are thinking of developing. The challenge is determining exactly what they are going to test. As we’ve gone through in detail, the things that would be easy to test, such as technical acumen, are just table stakes when it comes to finding a great analytic professional. It isn’t too hard to validate if a person knows how to code or can identify the assumptions behind a linear regression. But how do you test creativity? How do you test intuition? How do you test business savvy? How do you test presentation skills? And how do you test those traits in the context of analytics? That is much more difficult.</p>
<p class="para">It’s not a bad thing to have analytic professionals demonstrate that they have the skills and motivation to pass a relevant exam. The issue is that any certification that is plausible to develop in terms of cost and validity will largely focus on technical skills. Such an exam may become a table stakes criterion, and at least it will prove that a person has been certified on the technical skills and had enough motivation to go out and get the certification. From there you can figure out if they have the other factors, like creativity, that you really need on top of those technical skills. Used that way, a certification program can be a good thing. Used as a benchmark or standard all by itself, a certification program will likely fall short.</p>
<p class="para">Will a certification program be widely adopted in the analytics community? Certainly if all the various organizations trying to develop such certifications bring something to market, there will be some shakeout until one or two winners emerge. However, no matter how good the exams may come to be, organizations shouldn’t hire purely based on a technical certification. Per the earlier conversation about job requirements, organizations may not even want to make it a firm requirement. Having such exams will be of value as long as they are put in context.</p>
<p class="para">In the end, great analytic professionals simply get it. They “get” data. They know how to use it, they know how to organize it, and they can see the patterns in it. Great analytic professionals “get” the business problem. They understand why what a businessperson is asking is important and why it needs to be solved. They understand what constraints exist and how to provide answers that address the needs of those asking. Great analytic professionals “get” how to frame a problem correctly. Is revenue important, or is margin important? What’s really the crux of the issue and why? How should the analysis be designed? Last, great analytic professionals “get” that they cannot view themselves simply as scientists. The best in the business are artists as well!</p>
<h1 id="c08-sec1-0007">WRAP-UP</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most important lessons to take away from this chapter are:</p>
<ul><li>When hiring analytic professionals, consider common technical and educational requirements a starting point, not an end point.</li>
<li>Consider hiring analytic professionals who have differing industry backgrounds, as there is a lot to learn from what other industries are doing.</li>
<li>Commitment, creativity, business savvy, presentation skills, and intuition are critically important, and often underrated, traits in great analytic professionals.</li>
<li>Only a small portion of those with the required technical skills will cross the bar in the previously mentioned less-technical skills.</li>
<li>Great analytic professionals focus on improving the business, not perfection. It is important to know when results are good enough to enable a decision and then move to the next problem.</li>
<li>Great analytic professionals tie the level of concern about data’s accuracy to the level of granularity of the decision required. Imperfect data can still have enough power to answer a lot of questions effectively.</li>
<li>Today’s offshore analytics offerings focus almost purely on technical skills. Use them only in conjunction with great analytic professionals on staff at home.</li>
<li>While getting solid results is important, as least 50 percent of the perceived success or failure of projects will be how analytic professionals present and position their results to non-technical project sponsors.</li>
<li>Analytics certifications are under development by a number of organizations. Time will tell if the exams will be widely adopted or not, but certainly they will only be a starting point in assessing a candidate.</li>
<li>One fact that surprises many people is that the greatest analytic professionals are data artists as much as they are data scientists. Do not underestimate the importance of artistic talents in a great analytic professional.</li></ul>
