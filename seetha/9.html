<p class="chaptertitle">What Makes a Great Analytics Team?</p>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Many organizations struggle with how to structure analytics teams. Unlike human resources or finance departments, there isn’t consistency in where analytic professionals fit in an organization or even the scope of their jobs. As a review, when we discuss analytics in this book, we are referring to things like predictive modeling, data mining, and other advanced analytics work as opposed to reporting and spreadsheet work. When we discuss analytic professionals, we’re discussing the people who do such work. Many companies have different analytic professionals working for different parts of the company, where the problems they are addressing, the methods they are using, and even the kind of training they need are vastly different.</p>
<p class="para">With other disciplines it’s not always so complicated. Typically, human resources will be a centralized organization. Even if there are people assigned to help recruit for different business units, the definition of a recruiter and the job they’re doing is fairly consistent, as are the skills that they need. This isn’t as true in analytics. Imagine the difference between the analytics that an operations department needs opposed to what a merchandising department needs. Or how different the focus of a risk management team is opposed to a marketing team.</p>
<p class="para">This raises some questions. How should an organization structure analytics teams? Where do the teams fit in the organization? What will set the organization up for the most success? How much of this must be figured out before getting started? This chapter is going to talk about some of the common challenges that analytics teams face, regardless of where they sit on an organizational chart. Those challenges must be overcome if it is desired to build a great analytics team that will be able to tame big data. Let’s dig in!</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0002">ALL INDUSTRIES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Some industries have analytics highly embedded in their decision processes. Some of the best examples of this would be the banking, financial, and logistics industries. Companies in those industries have analytic professionals throughout their organizations. Risk management, for example, is driven by analytics. All the credit card solicitations you get in the mail are driven by analytics. Before a card application hits your mailbox, your data has been exhaustively analyzed, and it has been determined that you are a good risk for the offer in your hand. It’s hard to find anything but a small regional bank that doesn’t have a strong pool of analytics talent in the organization. Credit solicitations are one area where the power of analytics is so well established that nobody dares to act without analysis. Entire companies have risen to power by being better able to pick out customers who will not default on their credit card debt.</p>
<p class="para">There are other industries where it’s very much a mixed bag. In these industries there are some companies that are getting deep into analytics and other companies that have hardly started. Retail and manufacturing would be examples of this. There are some manufacturers that are very sophisticated in their use of analytics. At the same time there are some manufacturers that are household names doing hardly anything beyond spreadsheet-based analysis. How much better could those manufacturers be with even a little more analysis?</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">KNOW WHERE YOUR INDUSTRY FALLS</div>
<div class="featurepara">There’s good news and bad news. If you are in an industry that is heavily into analytics, then there will be a lot of analytic professionals with the right experience to recruit. However, your organization will need to push to keep up with the leaders. If you are in an industry that doesn’t value analytics, you’ll have a chance to establish a lead on the competition. Unfortunately, you won’t have as many winning formulas proven by others to follow.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">There are nationally known retail chains that send the same mix of clothing sizes to all stores. Have you ever noticed how many stores never have your size, but they have a bunch of sizes you can’t wear? Many retailers still haven’t even tried to match a store’s inventory to local demand. Even if their aggregate purchases are in the right size proportions, there is huge variation by store location based on who lives near and shops in the store. Size profiling is the process of determining the right mix of sizes for each store, typically for clothing, and stocking in that ratio. Some stores may require many more larges and some may require many more smalls. Many retailers have gotten wiser in this area, but many still have not.</p>
<p class="para">Even within a company that is using analytics, it may not be consistent across the organization. A company may be highly sophisticated in certain areas of its business, but not at all in others. Perhaps a telecommunications company is very advanced in the analytics being done for marketing purposes to stop churn (the loss of a customer to a competitor), yet it is very unsophisticated in building models to predict the impact of product pricing.</p>
<p class="para">There are a lot of challenges an organization will face in getting a great analytics team started. If a team already exists, there are challenges as it continues to grow. This is true regardless of where an industry falls along the spectrum. If you are reading this book, I assume that you want to help your organization do more with analytics in general and that you want to help it tame big data as well. If that’s the case, then the need for a great analytics team is a given.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0003">JUST GET STARTED!</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">It is important not to get frozen in a state of indecision just because it isn’t clear where to start. That would be the worst thing as it wastes time, prevents progress, and delays benefits from being realized. If the right people discussed in Chapter 8 are hired, they will help figure out how to best organize themselves to maximize effectiveness within an organization. Get the right people going after the right problems. Achieve that, and making a few tweaks to the organization chart over time is nothing.</p>
<p class="para">A few years back, a company I worked with came to us and wanted to dip its toe into the world of analytics. We built the company its first marketing models. Over time, we also helped revamp the measurement techniques the company used for their promotions and campaigns, among other work. It was a very successful partnership. The company kept hiring us to do more and more over a period of several years.</p>
<p class="para">The analytics we did together helped the company change a number of important things about its business. Staff at the company were able to identify segments of customers that they had been valuing incorrectly and marketing to with messages that weren’t appropriate. They fixed that. They were able to agree upon a single view of promotional performance rather than the several views that were used in different parts of the organization. With a unified view, it was far easier to agree on where to invest and what was working. No longer was it finance’s word against marketing’s word. They were also able to implement a more customer-centric view of their business by adding customer measures to a wide range of operational reports and analyses.</p>
<p class="para">After several years, the client started to ramp up their own team of full-time analytic professionals and made a commitment that over the long term the organization was going to invest in analytics. While we helped them derive their initial benefits and prove their case, they would have derived more benefits at a faster pace if they had committed fully sooner than they did. They were so concerned about where to start that they delayed the process for quite a while and didn’t realize all of the benefits they could have.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0004">THERE’S A TALENT CRUNCH OUT THERE</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">As your organization builds and grows an analytics team, you’re going to find that there are not enough good people. You’ll need at least a few great, game-changing analytic professionals like we discussed in Chapter 8 in your organization as it grows, and such people are few and far between. While many fields lack enough good people, this is even more true in the analytics field than in most others. That’s in part because of two things. First, the demand for analytic professionals is increasing rapidly. Books, articles, and blogs discussing the rapid increase in demand for analytical talent are everywhere. (Add this book to the list!) Second, the stream of analytical talent out of the educational system has always been fairly small. It is taking time for academic programs to adapt and scale to develop more talent.</p>
<p class="para">Even though the economy is far from ideal as this book is written, it is necessary to compete and win out over other companies for the right talent. It isn’t as simple as offering more pay or more benefits than an organization may be used to (although those will be important). It is also necessary to make sure that analytic professionals are given challenging problems and solid support for what they do. Once analytic professionals are on board, regardless of what they’re being paid, if they realize that their employer is not serious about analytics and that they are not going to have an impact, then they will leave. Analytic professionals are going to want money just like anybody else, and also just like anyone else, they want to think that what they’re doing is appreciated and is going to have an impact, and that they’re going to have a chance to increase their skills.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">BE HUMBLE</div>
<div class="featurepara">It is easy in a bad economy to assume that everyone is desperate for a job. Analytical talent is in such demand that good analytic professionals are not desperate. If you take analytic professionals for granted and treat them as if they are dispensable, you’ll lose them. It may be hard to get a raise approved for a new employee to get him or her in the door in a down economy. If that’s what it takes to get the right person, it is a small price and a great investment.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Even in the horrible economic environment of 2009–2011, analytic professionals were able to find a position that has the preceding features. Recruiters routinely post positions and people in the community frequently discuss the jobs they’ve heard about. Great analytic professionals are in such demand that in one of the worst economies of the past century, they are still hearing about jobs and having recruiters contact them. Your company policy may be one of squeezing salaries and not negotiating in a bad economy. You need to accept the fact, and convince your human resources department as well, that to get the right analytics talent you may have to loosen up a bit. This will be even more true in the next few years until the very small subset of analytic professionals who have experience working with big data and the technologies utilized to analyze big data grows larger. Given how new many big data sources there are and how new some of the tools are that are used to tame them, those who can walk in with experience will be hard to find.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0005">TEAM STRUCTURES</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">How should analytical resources be aligned so that the various business units in need of analytical support get what they each need while maintaining some type of enterprise consistency? This question has been addressed by a variety of others, including Tom Davenport and Jeanne Harris.<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/taming-the-big/9781118208786/p04.xhtml#c09note0001x" id="c09note0001xa" class="totri-footnote"><span class="superscript">1</span></a> Here, we will summarize the primary structural options, when each is appropriate, and how each works. Note that similar structures apply to other groups within a company as well, but we’ll focus on how they apply in the context of analytics. The primary structures fall into the three broad categories of decentralized/functional, centralized, and hybrid. Deciding the best fit for a given organization can be difficult.</p>
<p class="para">Recently, a company in the entertainment industry decided to pursue building a proficiency in analytics. The company had a number of different divisions that were independent operating entities. Since many of the divisions had been acquired, they were purposely kept separate because they each had their own type of work, style, and culture.</p>
<p class="para">One of the divisions decided to delve into predictive analytics. When it came time to get started, a question arose inside the parent organization. The parent organization felt it was a great thing that this division wanted to start using predictive analytics, but there were other divisions that had no interest whatsoever. The question was: Should the parent organization let the division go off and do its thing, and then hope that other divisions would adopt the same approach? Would the method the first division chose to use be the right one for other divisions as well? Alternatively, did the corporate team need to come up with a cohesive plan and let this division be the first to apply it? The other divisions could then use the same “official” processes over time when they were ready.</p>
<p class="para">There is not an easy answer to these questions. It is possible to argue to let the division go and build some successes. The company can then tweak the processes developed if needed for the other divisions. It is also possible to make the argument to get something more universal in place from a corporate perspective from the outset. The right answer is going to depend on an organization’s culture and what an organization is comfortable with. The company in this example decided to meet in the middle: It allowed the division to take the lead, but the parent organization stayed involved in the process as well.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0001">Decentralized/Functional Structures</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a decentralized organization, analytics resources report through a specific functional business unit. An analytics team reports to the group that it supports. In this model, analytic professionals who are doing operational analytics report through the operations team and chief operations officer (COO). Marketing analysts report through the marketing team and the chief marketing officer (CMO). Risk analysts report through the risk management team, and so forth.</p>
<p class="para">The advantage of this of configuration is that analytic professionals are embedded exactly where they need to be. They are immersed day to day with the businesspeople they support and the problems that they need to solve. This is usually the model where organizations start due to the fact that some part of the organization is going to be the first one to take the leap into analytics. As a result, the business unit that leaps first is going to be the first to hire an analytic professional. It is natural that the first hire will report to that unit. This is why it’s almost a given that an organization will start with a decentralized, functionally focused model. At first, a decentralized model will be as simple as having one small analytics team reporting to a single business unit.</p>
<p class="para">A downside of a decentralized model is that resources end up spread out across an organization. A lot of employees who have the same type of skills and background aren’t part of the same structure. They will have no formal, and possibly no informal, connections at all. Each analytics team is only exposed to the functional unit it is a part of. This isn’t an ideal situation over time. There may be no way for one team to borrow people from another in a time of need, for example, even if the other team has excess capacity.</p>
<p class="para">Another potential issue with decentralized teams is a lack of career path. Consider an organization with five business units that each have three or four analytic professionals on staff. Within each of those business units there’s not a whole lot of opportunity for those three or four analytic professionals to advance. At most, they can advance to running a team of three to four people. Even that is only possible when the current boss leaves. That is not a very compelling career path.</p>
<p class="para">Across the organization in this example, there are up to 20 analytic professionals. None of them have a lot of career mobility, and most of them have no contact with analytic professionals outside their own group. As a result, decentralization in its pure form may be best as a short- to mid-term solution as an analytics organization gets started. Over the long term, organizations should consider evolving to either a centralized model or to a hybrid model.</p>
<p class="para">This is not to say that there are not some cases where decentralized teams may make sense over even the long run. Within an airline, for example, there may be one analytics team focused on revenue management and another focused on marketing. The types of analysis, tools, and skills required for the two teams are different enough that it can be difficult to combine the teams effectively. If so, that is okay. Just be sure to consider the options periodically to ensure that making a change isn’t a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0002">Centralized Structures</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">In a centralized structure of the purest form, there will be one core analytics team located in one spot on the organizational chart. That team supports all of the various business units and their analytic needs. One of the challenges of a centralized team is deciding where it should reside. There are centralized analytics teams reporting to a chief financial officer (CFO). There are centralized analytics teams reporting to a COO. There are centralized analytics teams reporting to a chief information officer (CIO). There just isn’t a consistent model for where a centralized analytics team resides, and many organizations do it differently than others.</p>
<p class="para">An advantage of having a centralized team is the ability to reallocate resources as needed. Consider an organization where the operations team has three analytic professionals and the marketing team also has three. Operations is having a slow period and doesn’t have as much analysis to do or as much budget to spend as is typical. Marketing, however, is overworked due to some major new initiatives. In a purely decentralized setting, there’s no way for members of the operations analytics team to move over and help the marketing department. With a centralized structure it is easy for the person who manages all the analytic professionals to shift them around. The centralized structure helps mitigate the risks of variation in demand over time.</p>
<p class="para">Another big advantage of a centralized structure is that it provides the opportunity for analytic talent to get experience and exposure to multiple parts of the company and multiple types of analysis. Great analytic professionals are going to get bored doing the same stuff for 10 years. But if over those same 10 years a person can work with a variety of different business units, learn a range of new methods, and meet a lot of new people, then that’s a terrific thing. Such a setting challenges and increases the skills of the analytic professionals on the team. It is a win for both the analytic professionals and the organization.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">CENTRALIZED, BUT DEDICATED</div>
<div class="featurepara">Even if your organization adopts a fully centralized analytics structure, consider assigning resources to focus primarily on specific business units. Having consistency in the analytic professionals that business teams work with will help them grow more comfortable with analytics. The relationships developed with their regular analytic professionals can’t be underestimated in value.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">A disadvantage of centralized teams is that it is possible to end up with a lot of generalists who can do analysis across the organization, yet there are no individuals who can go deep in any specific area. It can also be disruptive to a business unit if different analytic professionals are popping in and out of the picture over time. For this reason, even a fully centralized team may still allocate specific people to help specific business units on a dedicated basis. Analytic professionals can report officially into a centralized group, but in practice they’re embedded with the business unit they are assigned to. From a day-to-day perspective the analytic professional is more or less considered a part of that team.</p>
<p class="para">A centralized analytics team will often charge back for their services to the business units. Sometimes, however, the team is considered corporate overhead. It’s probably easier from a perspective of making sure people are doing what’s really important if the team charges back. This makes the business units prioritize efforts. At the same time it is much more difficult to get innovative and exploratory analytics underway when a specific unit will have to pay for the efforts. Ideally, there will be some level of corporate budget set aside for the analytics team to work on new and innovative projects outside of what the business units individually fund. The taming of big data is a terrific target for such a budget. Fund early work at a corporate level and then let the business units fund later work once the value of big data has been proven.</p>
<p class="para">Don’t underestimate the importance of structuring an organization so that there is an ability for innovative analytics to occur. Expecting specific business units with tight budgets to fully fund innovative work is a stretch. New analytics need to be sponsored and supported at a high level and considered a strategic corporate investment.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0003">Hybrid Structures</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Hybrid structures are just what the name implies. In a hybrid structure there is a centralized team as well as dedicated teams within specific business units. This type of structure can arise for a variety of reasons. A common path leading to a hybrid structure is when one business unit led the charge with analytics. That unit may have a built up a solid analytics team and isn’t willing to give up control of that team. At the same time, other units have started ramping up their analytics efforts. To support the other units, a centralized team is formed. The original team, however, stays within the unit where it started.</p>
<p class="para">Another common hybrid model is where there’s a centralized core team, often called a center of excellence (COE) or center of expertise (COE as well), with analytic professionals who are tasked with keeping an enterprise view. While most analytic talent is embedded within the business units, there are a few resources who float and are tasked to make sure there’s consistency in the approaches and the tools being used across units. The COE team also focuses on capturing the knowledge gained from what the analytics teams in the business units have been successful in doing. The central analytics team can have either direct/formal or dotted line/informal reporting relationships with the business units’ analytic teams depending on the company.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">DON’T STRESS OVER STRUCTURE; STRESS OVER PEOPLE</div>
<div class="featurepara">It is worth reinforcing that the most important thing isn’t how you structure your analytics teams. The most important thing is that you have the right people doing the right analytics for the right reasons. It is also important to focus on creating an environment and culture that allows your organization to hire, grow, and retain the right analytics talent.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0006">KEEPING A GREAT TEAM’S SKILLS UP</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Within an organization’s analytics teams there will be differences in the skills and responsibilities of people of different levels, just as there are on any other team. There will be a seasoned executive or two along with fresh new hires straight out of school. As a team is initially built, it is necessary to focus on the specific skills critically needed at that point in time for the problems at hand. The team won’t be large enough to round it out better.</p>
<p class="para">However, as the team expands, it is important to consider specifically bringing in people with different analytic skill sets. Perhaps your organization’s initial hires had a very heavy background in data mining. As the team grows, it may be wise to consider someone with a strong optimization background or a strong forecasting background. Having analytic professionals with experience in different areas of analytics only provides more opportunities to identify new ways to add value to the business. In addition, as the team grows, it is possible to focus on creating career paths for the team. Initial hires are usually fairly experienced since they’ll have to successfully work on their own with little guidance from other experts. As the team grows, it is safe to start hiring less experienced analytic professionals and grow them.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0004">The Matrixed Approach</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One approach that helps keep analytic professionals’ skills sharp is what can be termed a “matrixed” approach. This is a non-hierarchical approach to running the team. The way it works is that for a given project, what is often called an analytics lead is assigned. The analytics lead takes care of several key functions. First, the lead will handle project management activities. Luckily, the amount of project management isn’t too daunting for most analytics projects, but the lead is responsible for whatever amount there is. Second, the lead has responsibility for setting the direction of the project, laying out the analysis plan, and making sure the team is meeting deadlines. Third and most important, the lead has ownership of compiling the results, interpreting and building recommendations from the results, and getting any required deliverables compiled. Underneath the analytics lead on a project will be one or more analytic professionals. They are responsible for executing the project work on a day-to-day basis under direction of the lead.</p>
<p class="para">An organization won’t necessarily have anyone with the title of analytics lead on the team. This is because being a lead on a project isn’t about a title or grade level; it’s about what’s needed for a given project. For example, a team may have two analytic professionals, Bob and Sue. On project A, Sue may be the lead, with Bob working under her. At the same time, on project B, Bob may be the lead, with Sue working under him. The lead for each project is based on who is the best fit. If a project is heavily forecasting oriented, then a person who’s highly familiar with forecasting problems will be the lead, for example.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">ENTER THE MATRIX!</div>
<div class="featurepara">A matrixed approach to managing an analytics team can be a terrific way to boost productivity, build team cohesiveness, and keep analytic professionals challenged. By keeping the focus on what people have to offer rather than their title or tenure, you create a culture where people are more likely to succeed and where everyone is focused on getting the right answers, not on who comes up with them.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Over time, of course, the strongest and most senior analytic professionals are going to be leads more often than not. Similarly, newer and weaker analytic professionals will fill the team member role more often than not. By not assigning projects purely based on level or seniority, however, it mixes things up. This is why using a matrixed approach to running an analytics team can be a good idea. By requiring the team to work together in different capacities, it’s amazing how tight-knit and cohesive the team can become. Egos are better kept in check since all team members know they will have to work under each of their peers from time to time. The team will really get to know each other and each member’s respective strengths. They will also learn a lot from each other, which brings us to cross training.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0005">Cross-Training</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">One of the most important things to do with an analytics team, regardless of how it is structured, is to ensure that analytic professionals are cross-training each other. If one person is just an absolutely amazing programmer, make sure that he or she is from time to time doing a lunch and learn for the team, or writing a document with tips and tricks, or mentoring others one-on-one, or even putting together a short class. The team is going to want to keep growing and be challenged. One of the best ways to do that is to let them delve into analytical areas they don’t know as well by working on projects with their peers. The person doing the teaching will find it rewarding along with the person being taught.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0006">Managers Can’t Lose Touch</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Analytics managers and executives need to stay engaged and to keep their skills from eroding. People in any line of work hate the “empty suit” who may be high up on the organization chart, but is perceived as not really knowing how to do anything. In some cases, the empty suit used to know how to do a lot of things and just lost it over time. Regardless, an empty suit is perceived as someone who currently just can’t do very much. He or she might talk the talk, but can’t walk the walk.</p>
<p class="para">Analytic professionals are often even more sensitive to such things than the average person. Many technical fields have the same issue. Technical people don’t tend to respect leaders who are telling them what to do, looking over their shoulder, and critiquing their work if the leader can’t walk the walk. If an analytic professional perceives that his or her management team is going to talk the talk of analytics, but can’t walk the walk of analytics, it’s going to be virtually impossible to keep his or her respect. This isn’t to say that it isn’t possible to manage analytic professionals if a manager isn’t as deep in every aspect of knowledge as the analytics team is. The key is for the manager to acknowledge the limits of his or her background and to trust the team on details that go deeper than his or her experience.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">KEEP MANAGER’S SKILLS FRESH&nbsp;…&nbsp;LIKE A JEDI KNIGHT!</div>
<div class="featurepara">In the <span class="italic">Star Wars</span> series, Yoda was often behind the scenes guiding the action. However, he was able to jump in and do battle with the best of them when required. Similarly, a great analytics manager might not be in the field every day, but when the time comes, he or she should be able to do analysis with the best of them. A team will stay on its toes when it knows its leader can still personally take care of business if required.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">To keep skills up, consider requiring that every analytics manager change duties at least once a year, go into the field, and actually do some analysis. This is a great way to keep their skills current, although it is a difficult plan to stick to. There are companies that use such an approach in general. I know of one restaurant chain that requires every employee to work in a restaurant a few days every year so that everyone will understand what’s happening on the front lines. It keeps everyone in touch with the real world, and those I know who work there find it a very valuable exercise each year.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0007">WHO SHOULD BE DOING ADVANCED ANALYTICS?</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">There’s a topic that comes up again and again on analytic community discussion boards and in conversations. I’ve even discussed this topic in my blog.<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/taming-the-big/9781118208786/p04.xhtml#c09note0002x" id="c09note0002xa" class="totri-footnote"><span class="superscript">2</span></a> The question is this: Given that there are now software tools with user-friendly interfaces for performing advanced analytics, is it a good idea to let people who aren’t trained in analytics do their own analysis using these tools?</p>
<p class="para">The issue underlying this question is that many people assume that having a tool that’s easy to navigate via a nice point-and-click interface implies that it is easy to use the tool correctly and appropriately. As we discussed in Chapter 6, this is not true. Just because a tool is easy to use does not mean it’s easy to use it correctly. In fact, the ease of use makes it incredibly easy to do exactly the wrong thing fast and unwittingly. For example, tools that generate SQL through a point-and-click interface will let users join data together in any way they please. It will put the syntax requested in place, but there is no guarantee that the syntax created makes any business sense at all.</p>
<p class="para">An organization needs to make sure that anyone who is going to use a tool of any type has the right skills, experience, and perspective to use it. An analytics tool may save a user some programming, but he or she still needs to understand the analytics that are being generated. If you were confident that a novice was asking the right question, that all of the data to answer it was ready and waiting in exactly the right format, and that the precise algorithm to apply was known, then virtually anybody could succeed. Under those terms, everything is laid out perfectly and the user is truly just going through the motions of hitting the buttons. In the real world, this perfect setup is never actually the case.</p>
<p class="para">A lot goes into building an appropriate analysis or model. The process goes beyond pointing and clicking in a tool. Is the right behavior being predicted? Is the best set of independent variables to support that prediction available? Does the analytic professional have the experience to know when things don’t look right? Does the analytic professional know how to address problems that arise? As we discussed in Chapter 7, there is no magic “easy” button for generating advanced analytics!</p>
<p class="para">This is not to say that novices without much training or skill can’t add value to an organization. It is simply a matter of ensuring that they don’t overreach their bounds and get into areas they shouldn’t. Most people within an organization should be sticking to predefined templates or reports, perhaps with a bit of basic ad hoc analysis on top. The heavier lifting should be left to the experts. The formal analytics team should be made up primarily of these experts.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0007">Illustrating Inconsistency</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The comments in the prior section sometimes lead people to the thought that analytic professionals are just being defensive. In fact, the points made are well accepted in many other lines of work. Somehow, people who don’t understand analytics don’t apply the same logic they would apply elsewhere. Let’s take a look at some illustrative examples that demonstrate why care needs to be taken to ensure the correct people and teams are performing advanced analytics work.</p>
<p class="para">Jane has decided she doesn’t want to be an analytic professional anymore, but wants to develop copy and artwork for her marketing department. She has installed on her computer the same modern, powerful graphics and content generation tools that the marketing team uses. She has taken hours of training on using those tools. She can create brochures, graphics, or whatever else she wants easily, because the software makes it simple to point and click and arrange pictures, images, and text. She walks down to the marketing department and says, “I’ve installed all your software tools on my computer. I’ve taken all of the available training. I’d like to join your team and create direct mail pieces, magazine ads, and product brochures. Do I have a job?” Jane would be laughed out of the room. Creating good marketing content is about more than simply pointing and clicking in a tool.</p>
<p class="para">John has decided he’d like to work on the CFO’s team and close the books each month. He found out what accounting software his company uses. Similar to Jane, he gets a lot of training on the software. He then goes down to the accounting department and says, “I’d like to help you close the books each month. I don’t have any finance or accounting background. However, I took all the courses offered for the software package that you use. I know which menu items to choose at each step of the monthly book close process. When can I start?” Do you think John will get that job?</p>
<p class="para">One last example: Joe’s neighbor has a big tree he needs taken down because it’s very sick. He asks Joe what tree service Joe would recommend. Joe responds, “You don’t need a tree service. I just bought a top-of-the-line chainsaw. I’ve read the manual cover to cover, the blade’s all sharpened, and it’s ready to go. I can be your tree service. Let’s go cut down that tree!” What neighbor would even consider such a silly proposition?</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">DON’T TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT</div>
<div class="featurepara">Most people laugh at the idea of a novice generating copy and art for a major marketing initiative, or a novice closing the corporate books, or a neighbor with a high-end chainsaw cutting down a tree. Why is it, then, that so many are willing to assume that a person with absolutely no relevant experience and a little bit of analytics tool training can build accurate, high-quality advanced analytic processes? Don’t fall into that trap.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">If an organization is to have a great analytics team, it will need to remember the art and science that make up effective analytics. Just as great artists likely didn’t paint a masterpiece the first time they painted, neither will great analytic teams be great from day one. It is something that evolves with practice and experience. Just as in other disciplines, there are complexities and nuances that are not obvious to those who aren’t familiar with the field. If someone wouldn’t allow a novice without the proper skills, training, and experience to do his or her own job, then he or she shouldn’t allow a novice without the proper skills, training, and experience to build advanced analytics processes. It is critical to build an analytics team from a base of qualified analytic professionals as discussed in Chapter 8, and not simply shift people from other parts of the organization and give them a new role and title.</p>
<h2 id="c09-sec2-0008">Enabling Analytic Novices to Succeed</h2>
<p class="paraaftertitle">Let’s now turn to a much more positive viewpoint. There are many people in an organization who want to leverage advanced analytics. Let’s assume Barb from marketing is one of them and she’s prepared to champion analytics for her business unit. She’s prepared to push to move things ahead. That is a terrific thing, and an analytics team certainly wants to support Barb and help her make that happen. The answer isn’t putting software on her computer so she can start cranking out her own analysis, however.</p>
<p class="para">We need to circle back for a moment to the idea that friendly analytic tools are productivity enhancers. Objecting to tools being given to people who don’t know what they’re doing is not about someone protecting analytic professionals’ jobs and rejecting new technology. If the concern was protecting analytic professionals’ jobs, people would be against user-friendly analytic tools across the board, not simply such tools in the wrong hands.</p>
<p class="para">A person with limited vision could argue that if he or she is part of a team of 10 analytic professionals and a productivity tool cuts the time it takes to do analytics work in half, that means half the team is going to get laid off. Anyone who would view the situation that way should be removed from the analytics team as they can’t possibly be a great analytic professional. The right way to look at is that there are 10 people who have justified their existence based on what they’re doing today. If suddenly they can get the current workload done in half the time, they now have half their time to address new problems and add even more value. Modern, friendly tools will only further justify analytic professionals’ existence, help them grow in skill, and provide them additional challenges. It’s a win all the way around.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">FOCUS EVERYONE ON WHAT THEY DO BEST</div>
<div class="featurepara">Businesspeople with no analytical expertise may want to leverage analytics, but they don’t need to do the actual heavy lifting. The job of the analytics team is to enable businesspeople to drive analytics through the organization. Let businesspeople spend their time selling the power of analytics upstream and changing the business processes they manage to make use of analytics. If analytics teams do what they do best and business teams do what they do best, it will be a winning combination.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">Hopefully you’re convinced that user-friendly analytic technologies themselves are a good thing. So how should an organization use them? The key is to enable Barb to reach her goals. That is not the same as having Barb actually do the dirty work. The analytics team should partner with Barb, help Barb get the analytics she needs, and allow her to run reports that summarize the performance of the models the team has built for her. Customer focused results should be mapped into Barb’s customer relationship management (CRM) suite. The results should also be made available to any other corporate applications that would benefit from them. Barb should be given the tools to leverage the analytics that the analytics team develops for her. She probably doesn’t <span class="italic">want</span> to do the dirty work herself any more than she <span class="italic">should</span> be doing it herself.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0008">WHY CAN’T IT AND ANALYTIC PROFESSIONALS GET ALONG?</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">A big issue organizations face as they build a great analytics team is the struggle between analytic professionals and IT. There is long-term animosity between IT and analytic professionals in many organizations. Believe it or not, there are actually logical, valid reasons why this tension arose in the past. It no longer needs to be this way, however. To understand why, let’s start by looking at the roles that IT and analytic professionals are given by an organization.</p>
<p class="para">As can be seen in <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/taming-the-big/9781118208786/p04.xhtml#c09tbl0001x" id="c09tbl0001xa">Table 9.1</a>, an analytic professional is hired and tasked with pressing boundaries and making new things happen with corporate data. An analytic professional needs to do new and innovative things and think out of the box. IT, however, is being paid by the same company to make sure systems are running smoothly and that everyone can get the work done that they need done. IT needs to ensure that resources are appropriately allocated and keep things under control.</p>
<p class="tablecaption"><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/taming-the-big/9781118208786/p04.xhtml#c09tbl0001xa" id="c09tbl0001x"><span class="bold">Table 9.1</span></a>&nbsp;The Roles of Analytic Professionals and IT</p>
<table class="bodytable" border="1"><thead><tr><td valign="bottom" class="headercell">Analytics teams are asked to:</td>
<td valign="bottom" class="headercell">IT teams are asked to:</td></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td class="bodycell">Heavily utilize system resources.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Tightly manage resource usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodycell">Create tables and use a lot of space.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Limit table creation and space usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodycell">Run complex ad hoc queries.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Minimize use of complex ad hoc queries.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodycell">Go outside the box.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Keep users within the box.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodycell">Experiment with new approaches.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Stick to approved approaches.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodycell">Work with limited rules and restrictions.</td>
<td class="bodycell">Enforce rules and restrictions.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="para">IT professionals and analytic professionals clash in part because the charters they are each given by their organization are inherently in conflict. They are paid by the same company to pursue conflicting priorities! One team is specifically tasked with locking down the data, controlling the data, and controlling resource usage. The other team is specifically tasked with crunching through the data, using lot of resources in the process, and doing things differently. It’s almost impossible not to have conflict in such a situation.</p>
<p class="para">What makes things even worse is that analytic professionals are typically reporting to the business while IT reports through the CIO. The very first person in an organization that has direct authority over both teams to make them work more nicely together is the CEO. It’s going to be very rare that two C-level executives want to go to the CEO and ask him to resolve disagreements between their teams.</p>
<div class="feature1"><div class="hr"><hr></div>
<div class="featuretitle">IT AND ANALYTICS TEAMS MUST SIGN A PEACE TREATY!</div>
<div class="featurepara">It is crucial that your organization gets its IT and analytics teams to sit down and come to agreement on how they’re going to work together. It is entirely possible with the technology available today for both teams to co-exist peacefully and even help each other prosper. The hardest part is getting people past the historical biases and the pent-up ill will that may exist. Make the effort, or it will be difficult to build a great analytics team.</div>
<div class="hr"><hr></div></div>
<p class="para">As a result of all this, analytic professionals are often viewed by IT as cowboys developing a “shadow” IT environment without any respect for rules and policies. At the same time, IT is often viewed by analytic professionals as a bunch of uptight control freaks who do nothing but stifle progress and put in place roadblocks.</p>
<p class="para">The good news is that a lot of the things that drove this animosity are no longer a factor. We’ve talked about the advent of sandboxing, in-database processing, and the convergence of the data analytic environments in Chapters 4 and 5. With these developments, it is possible to get past the gap between IT and analytic professionals. It is important that your organization bridges the gap if it is to build a great analytics team.</p>
<p class="para">One fact that can be hard to get analytic professionals to admit is that they would love to reach an agreement with IT. They don’t want to manage a separate system unless they view it as a necessary evil to get their work done. Why? Because great analytic professionals often work themselves out of the job they enjoy! Let’s explore how.</p>
<p class="para">If an analytics team has their own analytics environment that they have to maintain, it effectively makes the analytics team system administrators, production schedulers, and so forth. An analytic professional builds a great new analytic process that needs to run on a weekly basis. Guess what happens? He is the one who gets stuck babysitting that process every week. He is the one who has to monitor it. He is the one who has to figure out how to account for changes to the data feeds, or other system changes that impact the process.</p>
<p class="para">Analytic professionals don’t really want to do those things. Worse yet, as an analytic professional builds four, five, or six new analytic processes, pretty soon his or her job is almost entirely consumed with babysitting the production processes he or she has created. There is no longer time to do any new analytics! That’s a miserable outcome. The fact is that great analytics teams would love to hand over system administration, scheduling, backups, and such to IT. IT has people who do those things for a living, enjoy it, and are good at it. It’s much more efficient and everyone will be happier. It will free up time for the analytics team to focus on being great rather than just getting processes to run.</p>
<h1 id="c09-sec1-0009">WRAP-UP</h1>
<p class="paraaftertitle">The most important lessons to take away from this chapter are:</p>
<ul><li>Instead of evaluating how to structure a team indefinitely, make the first hire and get some great analytic professionals starting to address the right problems.</li>
<li>Be choosy in whom you hire. Success is far more dependent on the individuals who make up an analytics team than it is on the organizational structure in which that team is working.</li>
<li>There isn’t enough great analytics talent out there. Be prepared to be more aggressive than usual to bring the right team members on board.</li>
<li>Most organizations start with a decentralized, functional analytics team structure. Over time, a company often moves to a centralized or hybrid structure.</li>
<li>The organization should encourage, if not mandate, that analytics team members cross-train each other and push each other to expand their skills.</li>
<li>Consider a matrixed approach to analytic project work. Have a strong lead oversee the work of others on each project.</li>
<li>Analytic managers need to keep up with their skills and be able to still do work just like Yoda in the Jedi Knight example.</li>
<li>Easy to use tools are not a magic “easy” button that enable the unqualified to generate good analytics. They make it easy for unqualified people to do the wrong things.</li>
<li>Analytics teams need to enable their business partners to succeed with analytics. Analytic professionals should do the heavy lifting, but then make the results accessible to the business community.</li>
<li>Broker a peace agreement between the analytics team and IT. Nobody, especially the business partners both teams support, benefits from a dysfunctional relationship.</li></ul>
